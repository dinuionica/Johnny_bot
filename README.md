Johnny bot is a voice assistant created in python to automate various tasks. With its help a user can find out the date,
time can create notes, can install various applications, can access websites and many other important activities.

Download and Test:
```

```
On Linux:

```
$ python3 johnny_bot.py
```

The command line interface is quite intuitive, the user will have to enter commands 
that the shell will interpret and execute. The use of dynamic programming gives a plus
to this project because the execution is very fast and the memory is dislocated at the end.
